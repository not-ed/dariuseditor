About
</h1>

Darius Editor is a grid-based level editing tool used for creating custom levels for Destruction Darius 3D that was initially written alongside the game as it was being developed. It allows the user to create and export their own levels in the form of a specially formatted "seed" which can be pasted into the a dedicated menu in-game in order to play it. The editor also features a basic level file saving/loading, as well as a very basic form of error correction that will try to fix any errors in a level file's data if it occurs, as well as prevent the player from exporting a level to play if certain requirements are not met, such as failing to place a starting position for the player for example.

This program also uses assets from the original [Destruction Darius](https://gamejolt.com/games/destruction-darius/80097), which was created by [3kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/user/3kliksphilip) - Permission was obtained at the time of creation for the use of the original game's assets where appropriate.
